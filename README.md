# -Analyzing-Book-Sales-in-SQL

The project involved working with a fictional bookstore database to extract valuable information. Here's a step-by-step overview of how I approached the project as a college freshman:

<b>Step 1: Introduction</b>

The objective of the project was to utilize joins to analyze the bookstore database and uncover insights. By combining data from multiple tables, my aim was to derive meaningful information and gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

<b>Step 2: Exploring the Database</b>

To begin, I conducted a thorough exploration of the database. By executing simple queries, I analyzed the structure and meaning of the tables and columns. This step allowed me to grasp the relationships between different elements in the database.

<b>Step 3: Basic Join</b>

Once I had a comprehensive understanding of the database, I proceeded to perform a basic join operation. This involved combining two relevant tables to reveal new insights that couldn't be obtained from individual tables alone. By merging the data, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the bookstore dataset.

<b>Step 4: Advanced Join</b>

Building upon the basic join, I enhanced the operation by incorporating group by and count functionalities. This advanced technique allowed me to aggregate data based on specific columns and count occurrences. By doing so, I could extract more meaningful insights and identify patterns within the data.

<b>Step 5: Deriving Valuable Insights</b>

With the advanced join operation in place, I analyzed the results and derived valuable insights from the bookstore database. These insights provided significant information about customer preferences, popular book genres, and other relevant patterns discovered during the analysis.
